(Additional authorities to be added in final draft)Petition For Review 
Christopher J. Tossing, Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner, hereby petitions the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 808.10 and Wis. Stat. § (Rule) 809.62, to review the decision of the Court of Appeals, District IV, in In re the Marriage of Sarah M. Morgan v. Christopher J. Tossing, Appeal No. 2023AP2203, filed on July 10, 2025 (unpublished per curiam), affirming the Dane County Circuit Court’s denial of Mr. Tossing’s motion to modify child support.
Statement of the Issues Presented for Review
Did the circuit court erroneously exercise its discretion, and misapply the standards of Rottscheit v. Dumler, when it denied modification of Mr. Tossing’s child support obligation despite his prolonged incarceration and lack of prior support delinquencies? The circuit court denied relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the nature of Mr. Tossing’s offense and the children’s needs outweighed other factors, and that the denial of modification was within the court’s discretion.


Does Wisconsin law permit a child support order to remain unmodified during a lengthy incarceration even when doing so will create massive arrearages that the incarcerated parent will likely never be able to pay, and should this Court provide guidance for such cases? The Court of Appeals effectively answered yes, holding that under existing law the decision rests in the circuit court’s discretion and finding no abuse of discretion in this case, without articulating a clear standard for when refusing to modify support during long-term incarceration becomes unreasonable.


Whether leaving an indigent parent’s support obligation intact through a decade of incarceration—resulting in an unpayable debt—implicates fundamental fairness or constitutional concerns (such as due process or equal protection) that warrant this Court’s intervention? The Court of Appeals did not directly address this question, focusing instead on the discretionary standard; these broader implications were raised by Mr. Tossing but remain unresolved.
Statement of the Criteria for Granting Review
This case meets multiple criteria for Supreme Court review under Wis. Stat. § 809.62(1r). First, it presents a significant question of law that has not been adequately developed in Wisconsin: how courts should apply child support modification standards to an incarcerated parent whose confinement is lengthy enough to permanently alter his earning capacity. The Supreme Court’s only precedent on point, Rottscheit v. Dumler, 2003 WI 62, is now over two decades old and involved a much shorter incarceration. This petition asks the Court to clarify and refine the Rottscheit factors in the context of long-term imprisonment—a circumstance increasingly common and of great statewide importance.
Second, the Court of Appeals decision arguably conflicts with controlling precedent and legislative policy. The lower courts’ treatment of Mr. Tossing’s motion suggests that the “nature of the offense” was effectively treated as dispositive, overshadowing other considerations that Rottscheit deems relevant. This approach misreads Rottscheit, which emphasized a holistic, case-by-case balancing and specifically warned that no single factor (including the fact of incarceration or the voluntariness of the crime) should per se bar relief. Supreme Court review is warranted to ensure that its precedent is not misconstrued or applied in a formulaic manner that undermines the exercise of sound discretion. Indeed, the decision below effectively nullifies Rottscheit’s caution that lengthy incarcerations may tip the balance in favor of modification, thereby creating tension with the spirit of that precedent.
Third, the issue presented is one of statewide policy importance and is likely to recur. Many Wisconsin parents are incarcerated, and courts across the state confront motions to modify support due to incarceration. Yet there is little uniform guidance on how to handle cases where incarceration is not a short-term interruption but a long-term (or even permanent) reduction in earning ability. The lack of a clear standard risks inconsistent outcomes and may leave both parents and children in untenable situations. Denying modification will generate an enormous accrual of arrears and interest—projected to reach approximately $538,065.84 by 2051 if the $2,430 per month order remains in place. He will be 69 years old by then, and the youngest child will be 38 years old. Already $101,950.42 has accrued in just three years since Mr. Tossing’s incarceration, creating a debt he cannot realistically repay and harming both his rehabilitation and the children’s prospects of ever receiving meaningful support. The Wisconsin child support system lacks a coordinated approach for such scenarios, and guidance from this Court is needed to harmonize practice and prevent unreasonable results.
Finally, this case raises broader legal questions and potential constitutional concerns that extend beyond the immediate parties. While the focus is on statutory discretion, the consequences of leaving an indigent, incarcerated parent with an insurmountable support debt engage fundamental policy considerations. The accumulation of unpayable child support debt can be seen as implicating due process, insofar as it creates a permanent legal obligation with no hope of fulfillment – effectively a de facto life-long debt sentence without consideration of ability to pay. It also raises equal protection concerns: similarly situated indigent parents (those unable to pay support) are treated differently based solely on the reason for their indigency (incarceration due to a crime, deemed “voluntary,” versus other causes), a distinction that may lack a rational basis when the end result (inability to pay) is the same. Moreover, denying any modification in cases like this may bar meaningful access to the courts for relief – by the time the parent is released, the children will have aged out, and courts typically cannot retroactively adjust accumulated arrears, leaving the parent without a legal remedy to ever address the debt. These systemic issues underscore that the petition presents more than a routine exercise of discretion; it presents questions about how justice is administered in our child support system when criminal justice and family law intersect.
In sum, Supreme Court review is warranted to clarify the law, to correct a misapplication of a leading precedent, and to address recurring issues of significant public interest. This case provides an ideal vehicle for the Court to offer much-needed guidance on balancing the obligation to support one’s children with the reality of long-term incarceration and post-incarceration poverty. The consequences of leaving such questions unresolved are far-reaching – not only for Mr. Tossing and his family, but for Wisconsin’s legal system and the many families it serves.
Statement of the Nature of the Case
This case arises from a post-divorce motion to modify child support due to the obligor’s incarceration. Christopher J. Tossing (the Petitioner-Appellant here) and Sarah M. Morgan divorced in 2017, and Mr. Tossing was ordered to pay child support for their two minor children. In 2022, Mr. Tossing was convicted and imprisoned. He moved the Dane County Circuit Court to reduce or suspend his child support during his incarceration, arguing that his imprisonment and lack of income constituted a substantial change in circumstances under Wis. Stat. § 767.59(1f)(a). The circuit court (Hon. Rhonda L. Lanford, presiding) denied the motion in 2023, relying on the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s decision in Rottscheit v. Dumler and concluding that modification was not warranted. The court’s order maintained Mr. Tossing’s pre-incarceration support obligation (approximately $2,430 per month) despite his inability to earn income while in prison.
Mr. Tossing, proceeding pro se, appealed the denial of his motion. On July 10, 2025, the Court of Appeals, District IV, issued an unpublished per curiam decision affirming the circuit court’s ruling. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that the circuit court had considered the relevant factors identified in Rottscheit and found no misuse of discretion in the court’s weighing of those factors. It concluded that the circuit court acted within the bounds of its discretion by giving greater weight to the nature of Mr. Tossing’s criminal conduct and the children’s need for support, as against the countervailing factor of Mr. Tossing’s lengthy loss of income. The Court of Appeals also denied Mr. Tossing’s motion for reconsideration (order dated August 7, 2025), which had pointed out certain factual errors in the decision and urged a re-examination of the Rottscheit analysis. Having exhausted his options in the lower courts, Mr. Tossing now petitions this Court for review.
Statement of Facts
Mr. Tossing and Ms. Morgan were married in 2008 and have two children, who are currently minors (ages 12 and 14 as of 2025). The couple divorced in 2017. At the time of divorce, Mr. Tossing was employed as a software engineer. The family court set his child support obligation at $2,430 per month, while Mr. Tossing was in Huber release (work-release privileges) for unrelated OWI offenses. His income actually dramatically increased as a result of being in Huber and working 60 hours/week. His incarceration in 2022 was for a completely different offense. He had no history of occurring arrearages while incarcerated until this current incarceration, and the “pattern” required by Rottscheit is not established. This stands in contrast to the obligor in Rottscheit, who had a documented pattern of repeated incarcerations and accrued child support arrearages during prior jail stints.
In 2022, circumstances changed dramatically. Mr. Tossing pled no contest to, Child Enticement – Sexual Contact involving one of his own children. This is a serious felony. In June 2022, he was sentenced to 10 years and 2 months of initial confinement, followed by 7 years and 10 months of extended supervision. As a result, Mr. Tossing will remain in state prison until 2032, and will be under supervision until 2040. He is currently 43 years old; he will be 50 years old at the time of release from prison, and 58 by the end of his extended supervision.
Upon incarceration, Mr. Tossing’s ability to earn any income dropped to effectively zero. He has no significant assets to cover the ongoing support. Given this substantial change in circumstances, he filed a pro se motion in the circuit court to modify (essentially suspend or substantially reduce) his child support while he is imprisoned. He argued that it is impossible for him to pay $2,430 per month with prison wages (which are pennies per hour - $8.67/month), and that accumulating a huge debt serves no one’s interests. In support of his motion, Mr. Tossing presented evidence and testimony regarding several key factors:
Length of Incarceration: At over 10 years of confinement, his sentence is far longer than the incarceration in any prior Wisconsin published case on this issue. For context, in Rottscheit v. Dumler, the father’s incarceration was approximately 3 years. Mr. Tossing’s term is more than triple that, meaning any suspension of income is not a short-term setback but a decade-long elimination of earning capacity.


Nature of the Offense and Prior History: Mr. Tossing acknowledged the seriousness of his crime. However, he emphasized that, unlike some cases, the offense was not part of a recurring pattern of criminal conduct related to prior support issues. While Mr. Tossing previously served Huber time for felony OWI offenses, this case represents his first extended confinement in state prison. More importantly, he had never before been imprisoned for any similar conduct, nor had he ever deliberately shirked his support obligations. In Rottscheit, by contrast, the father (Dumler) had been incarcerated multiple times for repeat OWI offenses and had accumulated child support arrears from those prior incarcerations. The Supreme Court in Rottscheit found that such a pattern demonstrated the parent’s disregard for his support responsibilities. Mr. Tossing’s situation is markedly different: there is no “pattern of offenses” showing willful indifference to support duties. His past compliance indicates a willingness to support his children when financially able.


Projected Arrearages: At the October 2023 de novo hearing, Mr. Tossing presented projections based on prison wages of $4.34 per month, showing that his debt upon release in 2032 would exceed $245,000, with interest and arrears ultimately surpassing $538,000 by 2051. Those numbers assumed the best-case scenario—that he could immediately resume full monthly payments of $2,430 upon release. In reality, his current prison wages are only $8.64 per month, and collections to date have been negligible ($2.80 in 2023, $39.80 in 2024, and $32.60 so far in 2025). His debt already stands at $101,950.42 after just three years of confinement.
For comparison: in Rottscheit, arrears projected at roughly $25,000 after three years were described as “a great deal of money” but not insurmountable. Here, Mr. Tossing faces ten times that amount at release—over $245,000—and a projected half-million dollars by 2051. What was deemed manageable in Rottscheit becomes, in this case, a financial impossibility.
If he cannot resume full payments in 2032—an outcome made highly likely by felony stigma, internet restrictions, and obsolescence of his prior career—the total obligation will grow far beyond even this half-million-dollar projection, locking him into an unending cycle of arrears. As Rottscheit itself warned, allowing debts of this scale to accrue only discourages payment, undermines the support system, and ensures the children see no meaningful support during their minority.
Employability and Future Earning Capacity: Mr. Tossing presented evidence that his future employment prospects are not just bleak, but permanently diminished. Before incarceration, he was a skilled software engineer. By the time he exits prison in 2032, however, technology will have advanced by a decade without him. Software development is a field where skills atrophy quickly, and the rise of new tools—such as AI-driven development in the 2020s—will render his pre-incarceration expertise outdated. Unlike in Rottscheit, where the Court assumed Dumler could return to his trade after a relatively short confinement (and could seek another modification if that assumption proved wrong), Mr. Tossing faces the opposite situation. His 10+ year confinement, release at age 50, and the fact that his children will be adults by then, mean that any later motion for modification would come too late to matter. Compounding this, because his offense was a sex offense involving a minor, it is anticipated that extended supervision conditions will heavily restrict or monitor his internet usage. Many such rules effectively bar sex offenders from IT-related jobs, especially those requiring unsupervised computer access. Together with the stigma of a felony conviction, these conditions make it virtually impossible for Mr. Tossing to return to the IT field at all. This is not a temporary barrier, as in Rottscheit; it is a permanent collapse of employability. Yet the trial and appellate courts did not meaningfully analyze this factor—they simply noted his age and moved on. Wisconsin law remains unsettled on how courts should treat permanent barriers to employment versus temporary ones. This case squarely presents that gap and calls for Supreme Court guidance.


Needs of the Children: The children’s need for support remains, of course, an important factor. At the hearing, it was noted that the children’s living expenses and needs have not diminished; if anything, the custodial parent (Ms. Morgan) bears a heavier load with Mr. Tossing unable to contribute from prison. However, it was also undisputed that Mr. Tossing simply has no present ability to pay any meaningful amount toward those needs while incarcerated. The question thus presented was whether it is better to set the support at $0 (or a minimal amount) during incarceration—acknowledging reality—or to leave an uncollectable order in place purely to symbolically reflect the children’s needs, despite no actual support being forthcoming.
At the motion hearing, the circuit court recognized that Mr. Tossing was in a “difficult financial situation” through no one’s fault but his own. The court explicitly noted it considered factors such as the length of incarceration, Mr. Tossing’s age and assets, his future employment prospects, and the nature of his offense. The court, however, placed particular emphasis on Mr. Tossing’s intentional criminal conduct and the fact that this conduct was directed against his own child. The judge asked Mr. Tossing on the record: “Do you accept that every hardship you’ve described is a result of your own intentional conduct toward your daughter?”. The court answered its own question in the affirmative, finding that Mr. Tossing’s predicament was self-induced by his crime. In its written decision, the circuit court quoted from Rottscheit and related cases, noting that having children is a long-term responsibility and that a parent cannot expect a child to “forego support” just because the parent is in prison. Ultimately, the court concluded that the needs of the children and the gravity of Mr. Tossing’s offense outweighed the other factors, and it denied the modification.
The Court of Appeals’ decision recounted much of the above factual background. The appellate court agreed that the circuit court had considered all the Rottscheit factors and found no erroneous exercise of discretion in how the court balanced them. The appellate decision highlighted that Rottscheit gives trial courts wide latitude, and that different factors need not be given equal weight. The panel acknowledged Mr. Tossing’s arguments about his long sentence and limited prospects, but it deferred to the trial court’s determination that the “nature of Tossing’s criminal conduct and the needs of the children outweighed any other factors” in this case. The Court of Appeals also addressed Mr. Tossing’s contention that his offense (child enticement) did not reflect a disregard for child support in the way that repeat OWI offenses did in Rottscheit. The court rejected that view, citing Rottscheit’s statement that even if an offense is not directly about avoiding support, a parent’s overall course of conduct and pattern of behavior are relevant. It noted that in Rottscheit, the Supreme Court found Dumler’s pattern of OWI and probation violations showed a disregard for his children’s welfare. By analogy, the appellate court reasoned that Mr. Tossing’s crime against his child was certainly relevant to consider, and it upheld the relevance of the offense’s nature in denying relief.
In sum, the facts show a stark tension: on one hand, a parent who has committed a grave offense and whose own misconduct led to his inability to earn, and on the other hand, the practical reality that continuing a full child support order during a decade of incarceration will not yield actual support but only a crippling debt. These facts set the stage for the legal question of how Wisconsin law directs courts to navigate such situations.
Argument
I. The Lower Courts Misapplied Rottscheit v. Dumler and Failed to Conduct a Meaningful Discretionary Balancing
 A. Misapplication of Rottscheit — Treating the Nature of the Offense as Dispositive
The decisions below reflect a fundamental misapplication of the Supreme Court’s guidance in Rottscheit v. Dumler, 2003 WI 62, which governs how incarceration should be treated in child support modifications. In Rottscheit, this Court made clear that incarceration is a factor to be considered, not an automatic bar or entitlement to relief, and that courts must examine the totality of the circumstances with an eye toward reaching a reasoned, fact-specific conclusion. While Rottscheit recognized that a parent’s criminal conduct can bear on their support obligations, it did so in a nuanced way: focusing on patterns of behavior that demonstrate a willful disregard for support responsibilities, and explicitly cautioning that the weight assigned to any given factor lies in the court’s discretion.
In Mr. Tossing’s case, however, the lower courts effectively turned one factor – the nature of his offense – into a trump card, to the exclusion of a true balancing of all factors. The circuit court’s ruling, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, hinged on the view that because Mr. Tossing’s incarceration resulted from his own intentional (and egregious) act, he should continue to shoulder the full support obligation regardless of his ability to pay. This approach reads like a per se rule in disguise: if the crime is morally reprehensible enough, modification will be denied. That is not what Rottscheit teaches.
Importantly, Rottscheit rejected the argument that “unless the offense relates to avoidance of child support, the nature of the offense is irrelevant” – the Court said no, the nature and course of conduct can be relevant. But the flip side is that Rottscheit did not hold that the nature of the offense is dispositive in every case. Rather, the Court in Rottscheit illustrated why the offense mattered in Dumler’s case: because his repeated drunk driving offenses (and related probation violation) formed a pattern – he had been incarcerated before for the same behaviors, had accrued arrears in those prior stints, knew the consequences, yet re-offended. It was this pattern of disregard for his support obligations that the Court found highly relevant. In other words, Rottscheit teaches that it is not the mere fact of a serious crime that matters, but whether the parent’s overall behavior evidences a lack of responsibility toward their support duty.
Mr. Tossing’s situation does not fit the Rottscheit/Dumler paradigm. He had no prior offenses of a similar nature and was current on all support payments before this incarceration. There is no “course of conduct over a period of time” showing that he repeatedly chose criminal activity knowing it would impede support—unlike Dumler, who “continued to behave in the same manner” despite knowing the impact on his children. Mr. Tossing’s offense, while gravely serious, was a singular event with respect to his family obligations. It does not demonstrate that he wilfully prioritized criminality over supporting his kids in the way a repeat OWI offender’s pattern might.
The Court of Appeals, in ¶9 of its decision, rejected Mr. Tossing’s argument that Rottscheit required a demonstrated pattern of misconduct before the “nature of the offense” could weigh against modification. The panel stated that Mr. Tossing read Rottscheit “too narrowly” and concluded that courts may treat the offense itself as relevant even absent such a pattern. It is true that the nature of an offense may be considered—but the weight it carries must be rationally tied to the purposes of child support. Here, the “nature” of Mr. Tossing’s offense was not analyzed in terms of his ability to pay support; rather, it was treated primarily in a retributive sense: because the crime was serious, the court would not reduce the obligation. That is problematic. Child support is not a criminal sanction; it is a civil duty to meet children’s needs. Wisconsin law directs that support orders be fair, reasonable, and in the children’s best interests. Punishing a parent by imposing an order that is mathematically impossible to meet does not benefit the children—it only ensures the accrual of debt. Rottscheit itself cautioned that “child support payments are to be held to a reasonable standard,” and warned that “allowing arrearages to accumulate endlessly” undermines the incentive to pay. The lower courts’ rulings here contravene that principle. By leaving in place an order that will accumulate into the hundreds of thousands of dollars during imprisonment, the courts below guaranteed that Mr. Tossing will emerge from confinement under a mountain of debt that is functionally unpayable—undermining both rehabilitation and the long-term interests of the children. This outcome flouts the “reasonable standard” that Rottscheit championed.
Furthermore, the appellate court’s deference to the circuit court’s cursory analysis highlights a breakdown in the required discretionary process. An appellate court is to ensure that the lower court “examined the evidence, applied the proper legal standards, and reached a reasoned conclusion.” Voecks v. Voecks, 171 Wis. 2d 184, 189, 491 N.W.2d 107 (Ct. App. 1992); Rottscheit, 262 Wis. 2d 292, ¶11. Here, the circuit court’s on-record reasoning was thin—it largely recited Mr. Tossing’s circumstances (long sentence, etc.) and then stated that nonetheless, because he caused these circumstances and the children still need support, no change would be made. The court did not delve into how those factors balanced out; it did not, for example, explain why a projected $300,000+ arrearage was deemed a reasonable outcome in light of Mr. Tossing’s zero income. The absence of such analysis suggests that the court failed to exercise truly “informed” discretion. Instead, it treated the matter as straightforward: crime equals no relief. The Court of Appeals should have flagged this lack of reasoned analysis as an erroneous exercise of discretion. Instead, it effectively rubber-stamped the circuit court’s decision, saying that referencing the factors was enough.
This sets a troubling precedent (even if unpublished) that a trial court can simply enumerate the Rottscheit factors, state the parent is at fault, and deny modification—without demonstrating any real weighing of the competing considerations. Such an approach reduces the Rottscheit inquiry to a checklist and deprives the “exercise of discretion” of its meaning. As Mr. Tossing argued in his reconsideration motion, “referencing factors and evaluating them are not the same”. Appellate oversight exists to catch precisely this scenario: where a court nominally recites the law but does not actually apply it to reach a reasoned result. By failing to insist on a genuine balancing analysis, the Court of Appeals’ decision undermines the protections of careful discretionary decision-making in family law.
In summary, the lower courts misapplied Rottscheit by: (a) giving overwhelming, determinative weight to the nature of Mr. Tossing’s offense without properly considering how that factor relates to his actual ability or willingness to pay support; (b) ignoring critical distinctions—such as the absence of prior arrears before current incarceration or repeat offenses—that made the Rottscheit “disregard” rationale inapplicable; and (c) tolerating a perfunctory analysis that failed to grapple with the core issue of reasonableness of the support obligation under unprecedented circumstances. Supreme Court review is needed to correct this misapplication and to reinforce that true discretion requires more than just reciting factors—it requires reasoned judgment that can be articulated and reviewed.
B. Failure of True Discretionary Review — Parroting Factors Without Evaluation
Wisconsin law is clear: an exercise of discretion is valid only when the circuit court (1) examines the relevant evidence, (2) applies the proper legal standards, and (3) reaches a reasoned conclusion. Voecks v. Voecks, 171 Wis. 2d 184, 189 (Ct. App. 1992); Rottscheit v. Dumler, 2003 WI 62, ¶11.
In this case, that process never occurred. The circuit court largely parroted back Mr. Tossing’s circumstances—his long sentence, lack of income, age, and employment challenges—before concluding, without real analysis, that because he caused his own situation and the children still need support, no modification would be made. That is not a weighing of factors; it is a summary followed by a conclusion.
The Court of Appeals, instead of insisting on a genuine exercise of discretion, effectively rubber-stamped this approach, stating that the circuit court had “considered” the Rottscheit factors. But “referencing factors and evaluating them are not the same.” If repetition alone satisfies the standard of review, then appellate oversight loses its meaning, and trial courts are free to bypass the required balancing by simply reciting circumstances and invoking fault.
This raises a systemic problem. Discretion cannot be reduced to a checklist or a ritual incantation of factors—it must be demonstrated reasoning that can withstand appellate scrutiny. The Supreme Court’s intervention is needed to clarify what constitutes a valid exercise of discretion under Rottscheit in the child-support/incarceration context, and to reaffirm that appellate courts must enforce that standard rather than dilute it.
II. A Decade-Long Incarceration with Permanent Impact on Earning Capacity Warrants Modification Under Wisconsin Law
Even setting aside the procedural errors, Mr. Tossing’s case illustrates why Wisconsin law, properly understood, should allow for relief in situations of long-term incarceration. The unique facts here bring into sharp focus a question that Rottscheit foreshadowed but did not have to decide: When does the length of incarceration tip the balance in favor of modifying support? In Rottscheit, the Supreme Court noted in dicta that had Dumler’s incarceration been significantly longer (e.g., “ten, or even five, years”), a refusal to modify might well have been an abuse of discretion. Dumler’s term was relatively short (around three years), and the Court expressly distinguished the case before it from a hypothetical long sentence scenario. The implication of the Court’s discussion is clear: there exists a threshold of incarceration length beyond which it is unreasonable to simply let support obligations accrue unchanged. Mr. Tossing’s 10+ year incarceration squarely presents this scenario which Rottscheit hypothesized but did not rule on.
At over a decade, the duration of Mr. Tossing’s imprisonment is exceptional and has profound consequences for his finances. For ten years, he will have no meaningful earning capacity. This is not a temporary setback; it is essentially the loss of the prime years of his career. Unlike someone incarcerated for, say, one year (who might more easily pick up where they left off), Mr. Tossing will be entirely removed from the workforce and his field for a long period. As a result, his “earning capacity” has fundamentally changed, which is a recognized factor justifying modification (Wis. Stat. § 767.59 and Rottscheit, 262 Wis. 2d 292, ¶41 (factor of “the payer’s employability and … likelihood of future income upon release”). Here, all evidence indicates that Mr. Tossing’s future earning capacity is a mere fraction of what it was pre-incarceration. He will exit prison middle-aged, with obsolete skills in a competitive industry, and with legal and social barriers to employment. In economic terms, his human capital is being permanently diminished by this incarceration.
If Wisconsin’s law of child support modification is to remain grounded in reality, it must account for such permanent changes. Child support is calculated based on ability to pay, not as a moral sanction. The guidelines and statutes strive to ensure support orders are fair to all parties—balancing the needs of the child with the payer’s resources. When a payer’s resources plummet to near zero for a decade and are projected to be very limited even thereafter, continuing an order as if nothing changed is a legal fiction. It serves only to produce uncollectable debt. The Supreme Court in Rottscheit effectively said as much: “Wisconsin Stat. § 767.32 [now § 767.59] specifically allows for revision when circumstances have substantially changed.” Incarceration is explicitly acknowledged as a change in circumstance that gives the court competence to review the order. The exercise of discretion is then to determine whether to actually adjust the order. But that discretion is not limitless; it must be exercised within the bounds of reasonableness. When a parent will have no income for 10 years, a court that refuses to adjust support at all is essentially finding that a zero-income parent can somehow pay a high monthly support—an untenable position. It is notable that many jurisdictions (and child support enforcement agencies) now proactively suspend or reduce support for incarcerated parents to avoid exactly this scenario of ballooning arrears that serve no one. Wisconsin has not adopted a per se suspension rule, but the principles in Rottscheit push in the direction of relief when warranted by the facts.
Mr. Tossing’s case also reveals a gap in current Wisconsin jurisprudence: how to handle collateral consequences of incarceration such as lifelong restrictions and stigma that affect earning capacity. In Rottscheit, the Court assumed Dumler could get back on his feet upon release and even held out that he could seek another modification later if that assumption proved wrong. But Mr. Tossing will not have that opportunity – by the time he is out and struggling to find work, his children will be adults and the court will have no ongoing child support order to revise (just arrears, which courts cannot retroactively forgive absent an agreement or extraordinary circumstances). The notion of “he can request a modification later” (as Rottscheit mentioned) does not apply when later there is nothing left to modify because the support obligation ended when the children aged out. This is a crucial distinction. It means that the decision made now, during the incarceration, is effectively final and irreversible in its impact on support. If the current order is not modified, the resulting debt cannot later be undone. This is all the more reason that the decision now must be carefully considered and, Petitioner submits, why modification should be granted in this extraordinary circumstance.
The circuit court appeared to give decisive weight to an understandable moral intuition: that Mr. Tossing’s crime against his child makes him less deserving of relief. However, that intuition, if taken too far, turns the child support proceeding into an extension of the criminal punishment. Wisconsin law separates the two – child support is a civil obligation aimed at welfare of the child, not a punitive measure for the parent’s wrongdoing. Indeed, there is a risk of double-counting punishment: Mr. Tossing has already been punished with a lengthy prison term (and all its collateral effects). To then say he must also shoulder an impossible financial burden because of that same crime is to impose an additional penalty, one that Rottscheit warned should not automatically follow from the finding of voluntariness of the crime. The Supreme Court recognized that while incarceration results from “unreasonable” (and voluntary) behavior, that fact “should not be determinative of whether modification … is appropriate.”. Yet in Mr. Tossing’s case, the lower courts have made it determinative. The very factor that Rottscheit said should not dictate the outcome (the fact that the crime was intentional) ended up dictating the outcome here.
Wisconsin’s child support statute and the Rottscheit factors, properly applied to these facts, point toward granting a modification. Key factors favoring modification include: the extraordinary length of incarceration (a decade without income), the dramatically reduced future earning potential (approaching a near-permanent change due to outdated skills and supervision limits), and the massive arrears that will otherwise accrue, undermining the support purpose. On the other side of the ledger, the factors against modification include: the nature of the offense (very serious and involving the child) and the ongoing needs of the children. Petitioner acknowledges these latter factors are weighty – indeed, the needs of the children are always paramount. But critically, leaving the order intact does not actually meet the children’s needs; it only acknowledges them on paper. Ms. Morgan will not receive $2,430 a month from a prisoner; the children will not see that benefit. In fact, by potentially discouraging Mr. Tossing’s future compliance (due to a hopeless debt), the children could be worse off in the long run if he disengages completely. In contrast, a modification (for example, reducing support to zero or to a nominal amount during incarceration) would reflect reality now, and upon release, the order could be revisited to ensure Mr. Tossing contributes to his children to the extent he then can. Such an approach aligns with the overarching goal that support orders be tailored to ability to pay and adjustable as circumstances evolve.
In sum, the equities and legal factors in this case tilt towards granting relief, not denying it. The failure of the courts below to recognize that is not only a misfortune for Mr. Tossing, but it signals a broader need for this Court to articulate how cases of long-term incarceration should be handled. If this case does not merit at least a partial temporary adjustment of support, one has to ask: would any case of incarceration ever merit it? If a 10-year imprisonment with no prior arrears and permanent job loss isn’t enough, it is hard to imagine a scenario that would satisfy the lower courts’ apparent standard. Such a stance would effectively write a rule that “incarceration is never a basis to reduce support” – a rule specifically rejected by this Court in Rottscheit. The Supreme Court’s intervention is needed to make clear that trial courts must indeed grant modifications in extreme cases like this, or at least seriously engage with the factors in a way that a denial is rationally justified (which did not happen here).
III. This Case Presents Recurring, Statewide Legal Issues and Raises Important Policy and Constitutional Concerns Warranting Supreme Court Review
Beyond the particulars of Mr. Tossing’s case, this petition should be granted because it touches on larger issues in the administration of justice. Wisconsin’s courts and child support system face the challenge of handling support obligations for incarcerated parents on a regular basis. According to policy studies, a significant number of non-custodial parents in the child support caseload have spent time in jail or prison. The outcomes in these cases can have ripple effects: children’s financial well-being, parents’ post-incarceration reentry success, and the overall efficiency of the support enforcement system are all at stake.. Yet, as of now, Wisconsin lacks a clear, uniform approach. The law, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals here, leaves everything to the broad discretion of individual judges, which can lead to widely varying results and potential inequities.

Leaving support unmodified during a decade-long incarceration creates what amounts to a lifelong debt sentence with no connection to actual ability to pay. This Petition rests primarily on statutory and precedent grounds, but the constitutional backdrop cannot be ignored. Due process principles caution that individuals should not be punished for failing to perform the impossible. Yet that is the effect here: Mr. Tossing faces contempt or enforcement on a debt he had no ability to prevent from accruing. A system that knowingly imposes obligations that cannot be met risks creating a de facto debtor’s prison scenario, undermining both rehabilitation and the core fairness values embedded in our child support laws.
Equal protection concerns also arise because Wisconsin law readily grants relief when obligors lose income through layoffs or disability, but denies it when indigency stems from incarceration. Both parents are equally unable to pay, yet they are treated differently based solely on the source of their indigency. This Petition does not ask the Court to constitutionalize child support law, but the serious constitutional doubt surrounding the current approach heightens the importance of granting review now, before Wisconsin’s child support system becomes entrenched in practices that risk violating fundamental fairness.
For instance, in some counties, a judge might routinely grant a suspension of support for any incarceration over a certain length; in others, judges might never grant one, viewing any crime as a voluntary impoverishment. Such disparity means similarly situated families could be treated very differently purely based on geography or judicial philosophy, raising concerns of unequal justice. Supreme Court review can help establish consistent guidance. Without violating the discretionary nature of these decisions, the Court can articulate, for example, that when incarceration is long-term and creates essentially zero ability to pay, modifications should be strongly considered, and that courts should not allow astronomical arrearages to accumulate absent compelling reasons. The Court could also clarify the proper role of fault and the offense’s nature in this analysis, ensuring that personal condemnation does not eclipse objective financial realities.
Moreover, this case provides an opportunity for the Court to address constitutional overtones that, while perhaps not squarely decided in this proceeding, form an important backdrop. One such issue is due process: A core tenet of due process in the context of contempt or support enforcement is that one should not be penalized for failing to pay when it is impossible to pay. By analogy, maintaining an order that is impossible for a prisoner to pay, and then later potentially sanctioning them or ruining them financially for nonpayment, raises due process red flags. It is essentially setting someone up for failure. While Mr. Tossing’s situation has not yet reached the stage of enforcement or contempt (since he is in custody), the structure being put in place all but guarantees future conflict with basic fairness: upon release he could face enforcement actions (tax intercepts, property liens, credit damage, even renewed incarceration for contempt) on a debt that was unavoidable. The Supreme Court can intervene now to prevent a system outcome that would offend notions of fairness – akin to preventing a debtor’s prison scenario where a parent is trapped by a debt they had no means to prevent.
Another issue is equal protection. Wisconsin law treats incarcerated obligors differently from other obligors who experience job loss or income drop. In general, if a paying parent loses their job due to layoff or disability, courts readily find a substantial change in circumstances and often adjust support downward (at least temporarily) to reflect actual earnings. Incarcerated parents, however, have historically been looked at with more skepticism because their predicament is considered “self-inflicted.” This distinction, while intuitively understandable, becomes problematic at the extremes. Two parents could each have zero income – one because of a factory layoff, another because of imprisonment. The child’s need in both cases is unmet; neither parent can pay support currently. Yet the incarcerated parent might be refused relief where the unemployed parent would get relief. The question arises: is this differential treatment justified by a legitimate state interest, or is it a punitive holdover? The equal protection principle does not forbid all distinctions, but it does ask for rationality and fairness in classifications. From a policy perspective, the goal of child support law is to collect support for children, not to punish wrongdoing (that’s the criminal system’s role). Once a parent is incarcerated, the punishment is dealt by the Department of Corrections; the child support system’s interest should be in maximizing the likelihood of support when the parent can pay. Seen in that light, treating incarcerated parents especially harshly (by piling up debt) might actually be counterproductive and not rationally related to collecting support. The Supreme Court’s review can bring this broader perspective to the table, even if the Court ultimately decides on non-constitutional grounds.
Finally, there is an access to justice concern. Incarcerated individuals face enormous hurdles in participating in civil legal processes. Mr. Tossing proceeded pro se and attempted to navigate the system from prison. Many in his situation might not even know they can file for a modification, or might miss the window to do so timely. Wisconsin could consider procedures (as some states have) to make modifications during incarceration more automatic or streamlined. While that is a policy task largely for the legislature or DCF, a Supreme Court decision highlighting the issue can spur reforms and alert lower courts to be more proactive in ensuring fairness. There is also the aspect that once a child support order is set and not modified, accrued arrears generally cannot be retroactively reduced (Wis. Stat. § 767.59(1m)). Thus, if an incarcerated parent cannot effectively access the court or if the court denies relief, the result is locked in permanently. This magnifies the importance of getting it right the first time. The Supreme Court should grant review to emphasize the judiciary’s role in safeguarding fairness in these inflexible circumstances.
In conclusion of this section, the issues raised by this case go well beyond one father’s attempt to lower his payments. They strike at the balance our legal system must maintain between holding parents accountable and acknowledging reality. Children depend on support, but they also depend on having parents who, upon reentry to society, are not hopelessly indebted and disincentivized from legitimate work. Wisconsin has an interest in seeing returning offenders successfully pay what they can, rather than be overwhelmed by what they cannot. By granting review and ultimately providing guidance in this case, this Court can help align Wisconsin’s law with both reason and compassion, to the benefit of children, families, and the public fisc.
Conclusion
For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Tossing respectfully requests that this Court grant this Petition for Review. The decision below presents a significant error in the application of governing law and highlights a pressing need for clarification in an area affecting many Wisconsin families. By taking this case, the Court can ensure that the important questions raised—how to fairly handle child support during long-term incarceration and afterward—are addressed with the full weight of this state’s highest court. Only this Court can harmonize the competing policies and provide authoritative guidance to lower courts and litigants. Mr. Tossing asks the Court to accept review, reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, and remand to the circuit court with instructions consistent with the principles to be clarified by this Court (such as a proper discretionary analysis under Rottscheit that fully considers the extraordinary facts of this case). Such relief is necessary not only to do justice in this case, but to establish sound precedent for the future.
Respectfully submitted this ___ day of September, 2025.
