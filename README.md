Petition For Review 
This Petition asks the Wisconsin Supreme Court to decide whether Rottscheit v. Dumler, 2003 WI 62, has been misapplied to allow trial courts to deny all relief during a decade-long incarceration – leaving behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in uncollectable child support arrears. The Court of Appeals affirmed such a denial here in a way that both conflicts with Rottscheit and leaves Wisconsin law unsettled in a modern era of long prison sentences, technological obsolescence, felony stigma, and permanent employment barriers.
This case is an ideal vehicle for clarification. The record cleanly presents both (a) a misapplication of controlling precedent and (b) novel, recurring policy issues of statewide importance. The decision below not only distorts Rottscheit’s holistic balancing test, but it also raises serious fairness concerns – even implicating due process and equal protection principles – given the extreme, unpayable debt created by leaving an order untouched through a lengthy incarceration. Supreme Court guidance is urgently needed to harmonize the law, ensure child support remains rooted in reality, and prevent outcomes that undermine both the obligor’s incentive to pay and the children’s ultimate best interests.
Statement of the Issues
Conflict with Rottscheit – Misapplication of “Nature of the Offense”: Whether the Court of Appeals misapplied and distorted Rottscheit v. Dumler, 2003 WI 62, by treating the “nature of the offense” as dispositive in denying modification – contrary to Rottscheit’s emphasis on holistic balancing of multiple factors.


Reasonable Standard – Long Incarceration and Uncollectable Arrears: Whether leaving a full child support order in place during a decade-long incarceration – resulting in projected arrears exceeding half a million dollars – violates the “reasonable standard” recognized in Rottscheit. Rottscheit warned against allowing arrears to accumulate endlessly, yet the lower courts’ approach here leads to a virtually unpayable debt, arguably defeating the support system’s purpose.


Modern Realities & Statewide Importance: Whether Wisconsin law must adapt to modern realities (longer prison sentences, rapid technological change, internet restrictions on supervised release, and pervasive felony stigma) in guiding how courts assess future employability and prevent uncollectable arrears. In the absence of clear statewide standards, are trial courts equipped to fairly evaluate child support modifications for incarcerated obligors, or is clarification needed to avoid county-by-county disparities and potential due process/equal protection concerns?
Criteria for Review
A. Conflict with Controlling Precedent (Wis. Stat. § 809.62(1r)(d)): Review is warranted because the decision below directly conflicts with Rottscheit v. Dumler, 2003 WI 62. In Rottscheit, this Court emphasized that incarceration is not a per se bar to modification and that courts must genuinely weigh all relevant factors – not simply recite them. The Court of Appeals here recited the Rottscheit factors but allowed the trial court to make the “nature of the offense” outweigh all other considerations, effectively treating one factor as dispositive. This is exactly what Rottscheit cautioned against. By reducing the multi-factor test to a formality, the decision below undermines the integrity of Rottscheit’s holding. A published Court of Appeals decision that distorts a controlling Supreme Court precedent creates confusion for courts statewide and must be corrected.
B. Novel Issue and Statewide Importance (Wis. Stat. § 809.62(1r)(c)): This case presents a novel and urgent issue of law: how to handle child support orders during long-term incarcerations in the modern era. Rottscheit (2003) dealt with a short incarceration and an arrearage of ~$25,000 – “significant but not insurmountable.” Here, by contrast, Tossing will serve over 10 years in prison, during which his support debt will balloon to roughly $245,000 by his release in 2032 and nearly $538,000 by 2051, even if he resumes payments of $2,430 per month upon release. This tenfold increase in projected arrears far exceeds anything contemplated in Rottscheit.Such an outcome is not just unpayable; it is counterproductive, erasing any incentive for the obligor to attempt repayment and providing no real benefit to the children. Wisconsin currently lacks clear guidance for these extreme scenarios. Meanwhile, other jurisdictions – spurred by federal OCSE guidance in 2016 – have adopted reforms (including automatic suspension or adjustment of orders during incarceration) to prevent massive uncollectable arrears in cases like this. Wisconsin’s silence on the issue has led to county-by-county inconsistency and possible unfairness, raising broader concerns of equal protection (disparate treatment of similarly situated incarcerated parents) and due process (fundamental fairness in imposing obligations one cannot hope to meet). The Court’s clarification is needed to harmonize Wisconsin law with modern realities and ensure that child support enforcement remains fair, rational, and workable across the state.
Optional: This Petition does not ask the Court to reweigh facts, but rather to reaffirm the integrity of its own precedent and provide guidance urgently needed by courts and families statewide.
Statement of the Case
Factual Background: Respondent-Appellant Christopher Tossing (“Tossing”) and Peitioner-Respondent divorced in 2017. At that time, Tossing was confined in a county jail on unrelated OWI offenses but released daily on Huber work-release. The family court set child support at $2,430 per month – an amount he managed to pay in full, working 60+ hours per week while on Huber. Notably, Tossing accrued no arrears during that period; in fact, his income increased despite incarceration, and he consistently supported his children.
In 2022, Tossing was convicted of a serious felony unrelated to any prior offense. He received a lengthy sentence of 10 years and 2 months of initial confinement, followed by 7 years and 10 months of extended supervision. He is not eligible for release until 2032, when he will be about 50 years old.
Procedural History: In light of his dramatically changed circumstances, Tossing moved to modify his child support obligation. He argued that expecting him to pay $2,430/month with no income for a decade was untenable and contrary to the “reasonable standard” required by Wisconsin law. The circuit court denied any relief, leaving the full order in place. As a result, arrears have accumulated at an alarming rate since Tossing became incarcerated—approximately $101,950 in just three years—and are projected to reach around $245,000 by his release in 2032, with interest pushing the total even higher thereafter.
Tossing appealed, contending that the denial of modification was an erroneous exercise of discretion under Rottscheit. On July 10, 2025, the Court of Appeals issued a decision affirming the trial court. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that Tossing’s ten-year sentence “could be weighed more heavily in favor of modification than the payer’s sentence in Rottscheit”. Yet, in the next breath, it held that the “nature of [Tossing’s] criminal conduct” outweighed all other factors. In effect, the court allowed the serious nature of the offense to nullify the length-of-incarceration factor and every other consideration, including the impending huge arrears and Tossing’s future ability to pay. Tossing’s motion for reconsideration was denied on August 7, 2025, thus prompting this Petition. The record is fully developed on all relevant points, presenting the Court with a clean vehicle for addressing the important issues at stake.
Argument
I. The Decision Below Conflicts with Rottscheit v. Dumler (Track D)
In Rottscheit, this Court set forth a holistic balancing test for modifying child support when a payer is incarcerated. Crucially, Rottscheit rejected any per se rule and instead demanded a case-by-case analysis of multiple factors – including the nature of the offense, the length of incarceration, the payer’s past conduct regarding support, and the likelihood of future employability – to determine whether it is fair and reasonable to modify support. The Rottscheit court emphasized that no single factor should automatically trump the others; rather, courts must weigh them to reach a “reasoned conclusion”.
The Court of Appeals’ decision in this case cannot be reconciled with Rottscheit. Here, the trial court ostensibly listed the relevant factors but in substance made one factor – the heinous nature of Tossing’s offense – dispositive. The Court of Appeals then endorsed that approach. It explicitly noted that Tossing’s sentence is far longer than the sentence in Rottscheit and “could be weighed more heavily in favor of modification”. Yet it concluded that the severity of the crime “outweighed any other factor”, thereby justifying the denial of relief. This is not true balancing; it is precisely what Rottscheit warned against. Treating one factor (especially a morally charged factor like the nature of the crime) as an automatic bar to modification eviscerates the discretionary process. It reduces the Rottscheit test to a checklist formality: so long as a court recites the factors, it can deny modification based solely on offense severity, no matter how extreme the other circumstances.
Rottscheit’s facts underscore why the approach below is a misapplication. Dumler (the payer in Rottscheit) had demonstrated a pattern of disregard: he was repeatedly incarcerated for the same offense (multiple OWIs) and had accumulated arrears from prior stints in jail. He knew incarceration hindered his ability to pay, yet he continued the same behavior. It was this pattern of recidivism and neglect of support that led the Rottscheit court to deny relief in that case – not merely the type or moral nature of the offense. Indeed, Rottscheit stressed it was “not the type of offense” by itself, but the pattern showing willful disregard for support obligations that was critical.
By contrast, Tossing has no such pattern. His 2022 offense was entirely unrelated to his prior OWI offenses (it was not a repeat of past misconduct in defiance of his support duty). Until this long incarceration, he was current on support payments; he consistently paid support even under difficult circumstances of going through a serious criminal case. He did not exhibit the “four pillars” of disregard present in Rottscheit (repeated same offense, prior jail arrears, prior awareness of impact, and continued misconduct anyway). In short, nothing in Tossing’s history indicates an intentional evasion of child support. Treating him more harshly than the Rottscheit payer – simply because his crime is more serious in nature – flips Rottscheit on its head. The Court of Appeals’ reasoning effectively says any severe crime justifies no modification, even if the result is an absurdly large debt with no chance of payment. That approach conflicts with Rottscheit’s requirement of a reasonable, fact-specific exercise of discretion.
Moreover, the Court of Appeals’ endorsement of the trial court’s perfunctory analysis raises concerns that go beyond this case. The appellate court observed that the trial court “explicitly considered” the Rottscheit factors, but closer examination shows the court merely parroted Tossing’s circumstances (his age, sentence length, assets, etc.) without analyzing them. For instance, the trial court noted Tossing would be around 50 at release and still owe a large debt, yet it drew no reasoned conclusion from these facts – it simply denied the motion. The Court of Appeals shrugged this off as within the trial court’s discretion. If such superficial treatment qualifies as a “reasoned conclusion,” then Rottscheit’s mandate for genuine balancing is hollow. This Court’s review is needed to ensure that lower courts cannot evade meaningful review by checking boxes instead of truly weighing hardships and fairness. The misapplication of Rottscheit here – effectively converting a multi-factor test into a one-factor veto – warrants this Court’s intervention.
II. The Court Should Clarify the Law to Address Modern Realities and Prevent Injustice (Track C)
Beyond the clear conflict with precedent, this case highlights evolving issues of statewide importance that this Court should address. Wisconsin’s child support framework has not been clearly updated to handle the modern realities of long-term incarceration and its aftermath. Without guidance from this Court, the result will be inconsistent justice and potentially irreparable harm to families.
1. Unprecedented Length of Incarceration & Unpayable Arrears: The duration of Tossing’s incarceration (over 10 years) and the resulting explosion of arrears are far beyond the scenario in Rottscheit. By the time he is released in 2032, he will owe roughly $245,000 in unpaid support – ten times the arrears at issue in Rottscheit. And that debt will keep growing with statutory interest; if Tossing resumes payments of $2,430 per month upon release, it will not be paid in full until he nears age 70 in 2051, by which point the total could exceed half a million dollars. If he cannot resume full payments, the obligation will balloon even higher. No realistic job prospects would allow a 50-year-old felon to ever catch up on such a debt, especially as interest mounts. Rottscheit recognized that child support must be kept to a “reasonable standard” and specifically warned that allowing arrears to accumulate “endlessly” would discourage any attempt to pay. That is exactly the situation unfolding here. A support order that produces permanent, insurmountable debt is neither reasonable nor in the children’s long-term interest – it virtually guarantees no payments at all. The Court’s guidance is needed to determine at what point a support obligation during incarceration becomes so unreasonable that it must be adjusted. Failing to adjust in such extreme cases may even raise due process concerns, as the system imposes a punitive debt with no hope of fulfillment, akin to an unconstitutional debtors’ prison scenario once the parent is released and faces potential contempt.
2. Barriers to Post-Release Employability: When Rottscheit was decided in 2003, the world of work was very different. Dumler (the Rottscheit payer) had a short sentence (~3 year) and a consistent trade, and the Court optimistically noted he would have “no greater difficulty finding gainful employment upon release” than before, and could seek another modification if needed. In 2025 and beyond, such assumptions are no longer valid – especially for someone in Tossing’s position. Tossing will emerge after a decade behind bars into a radically changed job market. Prior to incarceration, he was a software engineer – a field that evolves rapidly. By 2032, his technical skills will be severely outdated, and the rise of AI-driven technologies may have displaced many roles that existed in 2022. Moreover, as a condition of extended supervision, Tossing may face internet usage restrictions (common for certain offenses), which would hinder him from even accessing the modern job search landscape or working in technology sectors. Additionally, the felony conviction stigma will be a profound barrier, particularly given the nature of the offense. Unlike Dumler, who could repeatedly seek modifications if he struggled, Tossing will not get another chance – his youngest child will age out of support while he is still incarcerated. In short, the challenges to Tossing’s future earning capacity are drastically greater than anything seen in Rottscheit. Yet neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals grappled with these realities. There was no finding on how Tossing’s earning capacity upon release might be virtually nonexistent – even though that is a critical factor in deciding whether modification now is warranted. This Court’s intervention is needed to ensure that lower courts properly consider modern reentry barriers (technological, legal, and societal) when evaluating support modifications. Ignoring these factors leads to decisions that are unmoored from reality and fundamentally unfair.
3. Disparity and Policy Vacuum Statewide: Without clear rules, Wisconsin courts are left adrift on how to handle child support for incarcerated parents. Some counties might reduce orders to $0 or a nominal amount during long confinements; others might rigidly refuse any adjustment, as happened here. This patchwork is untenable, especially when federal guidance (2016 U.S. Office of Child Support Enforcement guidelines) has urged states to recognize incarceration as a substantial change in circumstances and not treat it as voluntary unemployment. Many states have responded by enacting laws or policies to suspend or modify support obligations for incarcerated individuals after a certain period. Wisconsin, however, has not updated its statutes or case law on this point since Rottscheit. The result is a growing disparity and uncertainty that only this Court can resolve. Child support is a vital issue affecting children and parents across the state; clear standards are needed to ensure equal protection – that is, similarly situated parents are treated similarly – and to uphold public confidence that the system is fundamentally just. By granting review, this Court can clarify how Rottscheit applies to long-term imprisonments and provide much-needed guidance on balancing the needs of children with realistic expectations for obligors who are removed from the workforce for many years.
In sum, this case exemplifies a perfect storm of legal and policy challenges: a misapplication of an important precedent, a set of facts that strains the old framework, and broad implications for how Wisconsin handles child support in an era of mass incarceration and technological change. Only this Court can settle these questions. Clarifying the law now will not only resolve the instant case but also establish forward-looking principles to prevent similar injustices in the future.
Conclusion
The decision below both misapplies existing precedent and leaves urgent legal questions unanswered. By effectively permitting trial courts to ignore Rottscheit’s mandates and by failing to address the realities of extremely long incarcerations, the lower courts have set Wisconsin on a precarious path. This Court should grant review to reaffirm the proper application of Rottscheit, to provide guidance for long-term incarceration cases, and to ensure that Wisconsin’s child support law remains fair, rational, and workable in the modern era. Only through such clarification can we maintain a child support system that truly serves the best interests of children while upholding fundamental principles of justice for all parties involved.
